# APPROACH

As a student of the WDI program at General Assembly, I have had the privilege of learning new skills that, besides teaching me the technical aspects of web development, have also helped me to see things from a different perspective when it comes to problem solving.

This first project, Penalty Kicks, fulfills the minimum requirements in full (MVP) and also accomplishes some stretch goals.

In order to create a successful game, I focused mainly on the game logic, which states that a player has to release the ball during a specific time frame in order to score a goal. Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery and GarageBand - among other softwares - I was able to build a game that I hope you will enjoy!
