<!--
The minimum project requirements are mostly focused on functionality and
factibility of have a player interact with a ball in order to select an
specific destination on the goal, then switch player and allow the other
player to do the same.  -->

<!-- The scores are set on the initial round to a maximum of 5. whoever gets 2
goals ahead first wins the game
